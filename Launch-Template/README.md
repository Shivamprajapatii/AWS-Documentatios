# Launch Template: 
A launch template is a pre-saved form in which you pre-fill all the settings to create an EC2 instance - such as AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, user data, etc.                                               
(A Launch Template is a blueprint for launching EC2 instances.) it support Versioning also.

It saves your EC2 configuration like: 
- AMI ID
- Instance type
- Key pair
- Security group
- User data script
- IAM role                                                                                                      
So instead of configuring all this every time you launch an instance, you just use the Launch Template.
